# To-do 
- Git related
  - [x] git concpet, principle
    - git concept: repository, commit, branch, working directory, staging area, head
    - git principle:  
      - Git thinks of its data like a series of snapshots. If files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. 
      - Nearly every operation is local
      - Git stores everything in its database by the hash value of its contents.
      - Only add data generally
      - Three state: modifiled, staged, committed
  - [x] difference: git github gitee gitlab
    - git: **local** a distributed version control system for tracking changes, branches, and merges entirely on your machine without any network dependency.
    - github: **remote** ( based by git ) cloud-hosted Git platform optimized for open-source collaboration.
    - gitlab: **remote or self-hosted**  an end-to-end DevOps solution with both cloud and on-premise options.
    - gitee: **remote china** 
  - [x] files could/couldn't be tracked by git 
    - what:
      - normal files in right directory can be tracked ,such as .yaml .md .py
      - some abnormal files like .log .tmp would not be tracked
      - also files in .git/ or the inner files get its own .git like ./lab/.git then the father repositor would not be able to track the files inside but to track the directory as a pin.
      - .ignore of course 
  > my own recongnize vs gpt
    - Trackable: Files inside the repo that you git add (including pptx/docx/xlsx). Use Git LFS for big ones.
    - Not tracked: .git/, empty directories, ignored paths (node_modules/, .log, ~$.docx), files inside a nested repo, sparse-excluded paths.
    - Why: Git tracks files under the repo and respects ignore/isolation settings.
    - Fix: git add -f; git check-ignore -v; git rm --cached; clear flags; use Git LFS.
- SSH
  - [x] concept: 
    - a secure protocol for remote login and command execution.
  - [x] private, public key: 
    - The latter can be opened by the former. The server uses your public key to verify that you possess the matching private key.
- ubuntu
  - [ ] shell (bash),kernel
    - concept: terminal is just a simulator of keyboard and screen ,it's a software now to connect with computer. Only shell ,such as bash powershell ,can ubderstand your command which is similar to a translater between people & computer .
    - all shells:
      - win : cmd.exe ,powershell ,git bash(foe windows) ,WSL shell(linux)
      - Linux : bash ,(fish zsh) 
      - mac :terminal.app ,zsh ,bash
    - kernel :
      - concept :a core of an OS to manage CPU memory devices filesystems network security.运行在内核态（ring 0）
